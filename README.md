# flight-ticket-price-prediction
 "FLIGHT TICKET PRICE PREDICTION" using  a #random_forest_regression_model with #hyper_tuned parameter.
 
This project will help us to analyze flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset and then by using essential exploratory data analysis techniques will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.
